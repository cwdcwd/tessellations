**P**rogramming is a the art of translation. Taking an idea, a concept, a vision, a problem solution, and codifying it into something a machine can "understand". But the extent of a machine's understanding is that of a hand calculator. It can no more understand what it's being told than a river understands where it is flowing. A computer follows instructions just as a river follows the path to the high ground to the low. So, to expand the statement, Programming is the art of translatation of an idea to instruction; A repeatable list of commands to be executed with inputs and contingencies to handled.
