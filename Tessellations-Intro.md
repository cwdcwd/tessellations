**P**rogramming is a the art of translation. Taking an idea, a concept, a vision, a problem solution, and codifying it into something a machine can "understand". But the extent of a machine's understanding is that of a hand calculator. It can no more understand what it's being told than a river understands where it is flowing. A computer follows instructions just as a river follows the path to the high ground to the low. So, to expand the statement, Programming is the art of translatation of an idea to instruction; A repeatable list of commands to be executed with inputs and contingencies to handled. 

When repeating something over and over to solve a problem, you can start to see repeated behaviours in what you're doing. These can be "boxed up" and grouped together into reusable components. This is the essence of most modern, and certainly Object-Oriented, programming. We can create encapuslations around common functionality like grabbing input from a keyboard or drawing something on a screen. We can then further box up these components into larger and larger systems of components. And thus we arrive at the heart of this blog series: **Patterns**. 

Patterns are repeatable structures that are abstracted from specific implementaions.
